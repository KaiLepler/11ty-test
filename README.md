# Eleventy Site

This is a simple website generated by Eleventy. And this is a comment to check how this works with GitKraken.

## Getting Started

### Local publishing

The **Publish (Local)** button in the admin interface only works when the site is run locally with `npm start`. GitHub Pages is a static host and cannot accept POST requests to write files, so the button is hidden on the live site. To publish changes to the live site you must commit and push the generated markdown files to the repository.


### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Building the Site

To build the site once, run:

```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

This will generate the static HTML files in the `_site` directory.

### Running Locally (Development)

To build the site and serve it locally with hot-reloading (rebuilds automatically when you change files):

```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

This will typically make the site available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Project Structure

* `src/`: Contains the source files for the site (Markdown files, templates, CSS, etc.).
  * `_includes/`: Contains layout templates (e.g., `layout.njk`).
  * `css/`: Contains CSS files.
  * `index.md`: The main page of the site.
  * `another-page.md`: A sample additional page.
* `_site/`: Contains the generated static site (output directory). This directory is usually not committed to version control.
* `eleventy.config.js`: The Eleventy configuration file.
* `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.
* `.eleventyignore`: Specifies files and directories that Eleventy should ignore during the build process

# Eleventy Site

This is a simple website generated by Eleventy. And this is a comment to check how this works with GitKraken.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Building the Site

To build the site once, run:

```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

This will generate the static HTML files in the `_site` directory.

### Running Locally (Development)

To build the site and serve it locally with hot-reloading (rebuilds automatically when you change files):

```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

This will typically make the site available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Project Structure

* `src/`: Contains the source files for the site (Markdown files, templates, CSS, etc.).
  * `_includes/`: Contains layout templates (e.g., `layout.njk`).
  * `css/`: Contains CSS files.
  * `index.md`: The main page of the site.
  * `another-page.md`: A sample additional page.
* `_site/`: Contains the generated static site (output directory). This directory is usually not committed to version control.
* `eleventy.config.js`: The Eleventy configuration file.
* `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.
* `.eleventyignore`: Specifies files and directories that Eleventy should ignore during the build process
